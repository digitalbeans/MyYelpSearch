# MyYelpSearch

MyYelpSearch demonstrates using the Yelp Fusion API to retrieve and display a list of restaurants near you, by using your location. It uses the Alamofire cocoapod for network requests.

It will initially display the first 20 restaurants, and when you 
scroll to the end of the list, it will download and display the next available 20 restaurants. 

Selecting the "Category" button will show a list of restaurant categories. By selecting one of these categories, the list of restaurants will be filtered.

Requires iOS 12.0.
